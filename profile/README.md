# Build Log

>The Malibu isn’t an obvious choice, it’s deliberately inconvenient. A car wrapped in proprietary systems, digital locks, and engineering meant to keep people out. Every modification is an act of defiance against a design built to discourage modification. It’s not about chasing speed or trends; it’s about proving that even something meant to be untouchable can be reimagined. The challenge is the point.
